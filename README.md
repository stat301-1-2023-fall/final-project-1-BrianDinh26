## Final Project

This is the repository of my final project for STAT 301-1 analyzing building sales in Brooklyn from 2003 to 2017. The immediate files available are my executive summary, final report, and script files, while the rest of my repository is divided into data, images, and progress_memos. Data includes both my cleaned dataset and my raw dataset, which is in another subfolder labelled  "raw." The images folder contains images I used in the report. The progress_memos folder includes the first and second progress memo as well as the dataset.

The data folder does not have my raw or cleaned dataset in the GitHub because both files are greater than 100 MB. The raw dataset is linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tianhwu/brooklynhomes2003to2017/code. The cleaned dataset is linked here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_OyRKj4xWoZ5CgJ5v0GhLubceh9yT5wW?usp=sharing.
