## Datasets

This dataset is the Brooklyn Housing Sales from 2003 to 2017 dataset, linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tianhwu/brooklynhomes2003to2017/data. The data is larger than 100 MB, thus I am not committing it to my GitHub repository. The columns contain information about the building, neighborhood, when it was built, types of legal classes the building has, and much more, resulting in 111 columns of detailed information about each building.
