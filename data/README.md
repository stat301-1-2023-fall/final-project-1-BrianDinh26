## Datasets

This dataset is the cleaned version of the Brooklyn Housing Sales from 2003 to 2017 dataset, linked here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_OyRKj4xWoZ5CgJ5v0GhLubceh9yT5wW?usp=drive_link. The data is larger than 100 MB, thus I am not committing it to my GitHub repository. The columns contain information about the building, neighborhood, when it was built, types of legal classes the building has, and much more, resulting in, after cleaning, 81 columns of detailed information about each building.

For the original dataset, it can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tianhwu/brooklynhomes2003to2017/data.
